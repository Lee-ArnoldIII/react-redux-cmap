## Purpose

The project is a base user interface (UI) structure for teachers and students to communicate more efficiently and simplistically. This project was developed to demonstrate skills in using React and Redux in creating a frontend only web application. 

## Technologies

The following technologies were used to create this project
*[React](https://reactjs.org) - A JavaScript libary for building user interfaces
*[Redux](https://redux.js.org) - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
*[Bulma](https://bulma.io) - An open source CSS framework for clean and consistent styling
*[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - A user-friendly library that makes creating react apps easier

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

This project created some challenges as each stage of the process was completed. Some of the biggest 'take aways' are listed below:

*Structure is important - pre-writing the design of the tree and store are vital pre-work steps in creating a react-based application. 
*The Store - before doing any code, read the documentation about how to create a store and how it fits as a piece of the puzzle in the larger project. Mapping the store and key containers not only impacts syntactic structure, but also the semantic comprehension of a projects code.
*Size and performance - creating smaller, reusable containers is the most powerful advantage of using react. When paired with redux, these duplicatable components increase performance and also reduce the challenges posed by increasing scale.
